For LAB7 I used PSWindowsUpdate. I used this powershell package because I have to deal with out of date windows quite alot at my job and I felt that learning more about this could
really help me. Most of these will not have anything display for the usr imeadiatly and will be different on Windows server.

LAB71.ps1 gets an update from a specific source. in this case its NEt Framework update.

LAB72.ps1 Gets a list of available updates from windows server, very useful.

LAB73.ps1 returns infor about updates that do not need user permission to install.
