brett Tierney New Calc
newcalc.py

This python script uses the tkinter module to create a calculator on your pc. The calculations themselves are simply done by eval() which 
evaluates a string. This has limitations though and I was not able to get the sqrt and power buttons to work. I left the buttons in but did not delete the code.

I received alot of help with tkinter from: https://medium.com/@adeyinkaadegbenro/project-build-a-python-gui-calculator-fc92bddb744d

Simply run the python script for this to work.
